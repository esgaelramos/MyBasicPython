# MyBasicPython
This is my first Python repository. The main mission of this space is to make and save basic projects with this language. I'll use five principal sources: @estefaniacn of FreeCodeCamp in spanish, the courses 'Python-Basic' 'Python-Mid-Level' 'Python-POO', and the book "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" by Al Sweigart.
Make it with: Python versions 3.6 and 3.8.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Python and PIP.

```bash
  sudo apt install python3
```

## Usage

```python
python3 name-file.py
```

#### Directory 'basic'
